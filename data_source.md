# Pros and Cons of the Dataset

| Pros | Cons| 
| :--- | :--- |
| + WFS standard (standards are always great) | |
| + features all relevant information | - lots of overhead for basic requests |
| + GeoRSS notifies for changes | - information is Pull-Only; e.g. an MQTT interface, pushing changes as soon as they happen, would be nice |
| + German language can be understood by local users | - lingua franca and de facto standard in programming is English |
